    Auto Solve

    Function automatically simulates a game of Wordle using best guesses given that the true word is known.

    Parameters
    ----------
    true_word 5 letter string containing the true word
    tiles_grid numpy array of size (N,M,5) for every grid tile combination for every guess and true word pair
    plist numpy array of size (M,) containing every possible wordle answer word
    glist numpy array of size (N,) containing every possible wordle guess word
    sal_patterns numpy array of size (L,5) containing all L unique tile patterns for the starting word 'salet'
    sal_guess numpy array of size (L,) contaning the best second guess word given the first word is 'salet'
    cut_off=5 int, the number of possible words remaaning where only possible wordle answers are used as guesses
    
    Returns
    ----------
      guess 5 letter string answer to wordle
      count number of guesses taken
